# filesync Provider

The filesync provider enables declarative file synchronization to remote hosts via SSH/SFTP.

Unlike traditional provisioners, this provider:
- Tracks file state properly in Terraform state
- Detects drift on apply (fails if remote was modified externally)
- Supports plan-time change detection based on local file hashes

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "filesync" {
  ssh_user     = "root"
  ssh_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
}

resource "filesync_file" "config" {
  source      = "./config/app.conf"
  destination = "/etc/myapp/app.conf"
  host        = "192.168.1.100"
  mode        = "0644"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `bastion_host` (String) Default bastion/jump host address for multi-hop SSH connections.
- `bastion_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_key_path if not set.
- `bastion_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for bastion host (sensitive).
- `bastion_port` (Number) Default bastion host SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `bastion_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content for bastion host (sensitive). Falls back to ssh_private_key if not set.
- `bastion_user` (String) Default SSH user for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_user if not set.
- `connection_pool_enabled` (Boolean) Enable SSH connection pooling for improved performance when managing multiple files on the same host. Connections are reused across resources and automatically cleaned up after 5 minutes of inactivity. Defaults to false.
- `insecure_ignore_host_key` (Boolean) Skip SSH host key verification. WARNING: This is insecure and should only be used for testing or in trusted environments. Defaults to false.
- `max_retries` (Number) Maximum number of retry attempts for transient SSH failures (connection timeouts, network errors). Set to 0 to disable retries. Defaults to 3.
- `ssh_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH certificate content for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_certificate_path` (String) Default path to SSH certificate file for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file. Mutually exclusive with ssh_private_key.
- `ssh_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for password authentication (sensitive). Use this as an alternative to key-based authentication.
- `ssh_port` (Number) Default SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `ssh_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content (sensitive). Mutually exclusive with ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_user` (String) Default SSH user for connections. Can be overridden per-resource.
